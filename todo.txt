2 main things, 

1, to enter a new word and meaning to the dictionary
2, to easily search a word's meanings in contexts, by a fuzzy finder'ish method


json will make this much easier, no crude file managing methods needed, hopefully.




*find word:
  load file, find key in json, load json, list all context and meanings 
 important, this shall pull up all contexts and meanings in each context.


* display
