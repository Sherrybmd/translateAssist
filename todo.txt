2 main things, 

1, to enter a new word and meaning to the dictionary
2, to easily search a word's meanings in contexts, by a fuzzy finder'ish method


json will make this much easier, no crude file managing methods needed, hopefully.



*save to file:
  take the dictionary, append to file as json

*add word:
  store word that needs meaning, then add contexts and meanings equal to contexts, Like:
  [context]: [meaning/example to give idea about the word]

  Example:
      word = corrupt:
        emotional: the corrupt cop had no morales
        technical: the hard drive became corrupt, unfortunate
        fantasy: the chaos marines, misguided, corrupt by the crude gods, devolved into abominations.

  this adds to dictionary,
  needs to be pulled up when searching the word "corrupt"
  must store as dictionary:
    key = word
    value = contexts and their meanings


*find word:
  load file, find key in json, load json, list all context and meanings 
 important, this shall pull up all contexts and meanings in each context.
